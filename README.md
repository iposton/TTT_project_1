=============
This is my tic, tac, toe game made with angular. It will allow two players to play against eachother on separate devices. First player will choose X or O and make a move by selecting a square by clicking the square. When a player connects a row of 3 squares they will be declared the winner and get 1 point added to there score tracker vs their opponent. If for some reason their is no winner a tie game is decalred. 

From the  main index.html page loads press the green button that says play and the gameboard will load. Click the white button at the bottom of the page to refresh and start a new game. Enter your name in the input box above and it will insert your name at the top of board Player (name) Go! X is always the first symbol to appear when a game is started.

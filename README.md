TTT_project_1
=============
This is my tic, tac, toe game made with angular. It will allow two players to play against eachother on separate devices. First player will choose X or O and make a move by selecting a square by clicking the square. When a player connects a row of 3 squares they will be declared the winner and get 1 point added to there score tracker vs their opponent.
